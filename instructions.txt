We are going to build an exchange rate calculator
*Using the fetch api to make an HTTP request to a 3rd-party api to get some exchange rates (the response) and then put that into the DOM
*2 currency selectors for choosing any currency
*2 exchange rate values
*Swap button
*Exact exchange rate value

*The goal is get familiar with making requests and dealing with 3rd-party APIs
